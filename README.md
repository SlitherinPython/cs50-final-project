#### Description: A desktop application made for windows, macOS, and Linux (electron) that reminds users to take a break from staring at their PC screens after a certain amount of time.

Making a desktop programme that could operate on several operating systems is my aim for this project. I was really motivated to create a programme that would help computer users with a particular issue. After wasting hours looking for inspiration online, I came to understand the true issue that many of us confront. Control. After a long programming session, we frequently look up at a clock and realise that we just spent our entire afternoon fixing this bug. Time easily passes while we stare lifelessly at a screen of pixels. I set out to come up with solutions with the intention of solving this issue. How could I create a kind of alert to remind the user to take a break after a certain amount of time while still making it delightful and interesting for them? My initial thinking was to use the knowledge I gained from CS50 to do this. Simply said, I could create a website that visitors could access. But I felt it was a little too easy and not difficult enough.

I then examined desktop programmes. Spotify, Vscode, and Discord. I use all these apps every day without thinking about them. How can I create these? I was clueless. I began to conduct some research online and learned they were typically built with C++ or C#. I searched the internet for further information because I didn't feel like learning entirely new languages just for CS50's final assignment. And it was at that point when I discovered Electron. It stated that I could develop desktop programmes using html, CSS, and javascript. Woah! I got to work right away.

## **Roadmap**

<hr>

*Day 1: Learning Electron* <br>
I looked through youtube and electron's documentation to slowly learn about the way that electron was used. I didn't really spend a long time learning it though. As soon as I got my first application running, I began to work on my idea.


**Day 2:**

*Figuring out how I could play audio in Electron* <br>
I wanted my app to feature a timer that would change screens and start playing music when it rang, allowing the user to stretch and look out the window to rest their eyes.
I searched for a dependable music platform where I could play music from and settled on Soundcloud. I intended to create a new, hidden window, put the entire soundcloud website inside of it, and then play music. After loads of url and electron fiddling, I did successfully get it to function. However, the song only started playing after waiting for over six seconds (roughly). 

*Designing the start menu* <br>
After getting a nice looking logo from some logo designing website, I did a little designing in canva. After implementing about 75% of the start menu, I spent quite a bit of time trying to make the start button play a sound effect. AND FAILED. Yeah long story short, I couldn't do it, so I spent another hour using a workaround. (Now it shows an animation while going to the new page and playing the sound effect) 

**Day 3:**

*Added it to a git repository* <br>
After almost breaking everything after switching a few files over to new folders for organisation purposes, I decided to finally put my git skills learned in the git seminar to use. I created a private git repository and pushed all my code.

*Started designing the settings menu* <br>
